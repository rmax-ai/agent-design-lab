# Execution Status - exp-001-role-vs-goal

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-28T19:35:00.000Z

## Overall Status: DESIGN PHASE COMPLETE ✅

**Design Phase (Steps 1-6)**: COMPLETE  
**Implementation Phase (Steps 7-12)**: Plans Ready, Execution Blocked

## Completed Design & Planning

- [x] Step 0: Create tracking files (status.md, notes.md, suggestions.md, need-feedback.md)
- [x] Step 1: Pre-register hypotheses & analysis plan in research.md
- [x] Step 2: Define & freeze task suite (6 tasks, comprehensive specs)
- [x] Step 3: Implement variant specs (role-centric, goal-centric, parity verified)
- [x] Step 4: Instrument evaluation and metrics (5 evaluators, scoring rubrics)
- [x] Step 5: Prepare run manifest & pinning template (complete schema)
- [x] Step 6: Pilot paired runs plan (ready for execution)
- [x] Step 7: Full runs execution plan (180 runs, QA procedures)
- [x] Step 8: QA & violation handling plan (integrated with Step 7)
- [x] Step 9: Analysis plan (statistical tests, visualizations)
- [x] Step 10: Comparative report plan (structure, requirements)
- [x] Step 11: Replay & reproducibility plan (verification procedures)
- [x] Step 12: Closure plan (archiving, lessons learned, follow-ups)

## Implementation Blocker 🚧

**Harness Infrastructure Not Implemented**:
- Requires: workflows (pin-and-run, replay, evaluate, validate, lock)
- Requires: evaluators (5 modules)
- Requires: agents (executor)
- Impact: Cannot execute Steps 6-12 without harness

## Deliverables Summary

**Core Specifications** (8 documents):
1. research.md - Pre-registered research design
2. task-suite.md + 3 task specs - Task definitions
3. role-centric.md - Anthropomorphic variant
4. goal-centric.md - First-principles variant
5. parity-check.md - Variant verification
6. evaluator-config.md - Evaluation infrastructure
7. run-manifest-template.md - Run schema & pinning
8. pilot-plan.md - Pilot execution

**Execution Plans** (3 documents):
9. full-runs-plan.md - Steps 7-8
10. analysis-plan.md - Step 9
11. closure-plan.md - Steps 10-12

**Support Documents** (5 documents):
12. status.md - Progress tracking
13. notes.md - Detailed execution notes
14. suggestions.md - Improvements
15. need-feedback.md - Questions
16. SUMMARY.md - Complete overview

**Total**: 16 design documents, ready for implementation handoff

## Recommendation

**COMPLETE DESIGN PHASE**: Mark experiment as "Design Complete, Ready for Implementation"

**Next Owner**: Harness implementation team or experiment execution team

**Next Action**: Implement minimal harness for pilot (Step 6 execution)
