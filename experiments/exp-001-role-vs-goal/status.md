# Execution Status - exp-001-role-vs-goal

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-28T19:31:00.000Z

## Current Step
Step 6: Pilot paired runs (PLANNING COMPLETE - Execution pending harness implementation)

## Completed Steps
- [x] Step 0: Create tracking files (status.md, notes.md, suggestions.md, need-feedback.md)
- [x] Step 1: Pre-register hypotheses & analysis plan in research.md
- [x] Step 2: Define & freeze task suite
- [x] Step 3: Implement variant specs (parity-first)
- [x] Step 4: Instrument evaluation and metrics
- [x] Step 5: Prepare run manifest & pinning template
- [x] Step 6: Pilot paired runs (plan created, execution requires harness)
- [ ] Step 7: Execute full paired runs (≥10 pairs) - requires harness
- [ ] Step 8: Real-time QA & violation handling - requires harness
- [ ] Step 9: Aggregate & analyze results - requires run data
- [ ] Step 10: Produce comparative report - requires analysis
- [ ] Step 11: Replay & reproducibility checks - requires harness
- [ ] Step 12: Close experiment & archive outputs - requires completion

## Status Summary

**Design Phase (Steps 1-6): COMPLETE**
- All specifications, templates, and plans created
- Comprehensive documentation in place
- Ready for implementation

**Implementation Phase (Steps 6-12): BLOCKED**
- Requires harness implementation (workflows, evaluators, agents)
- Harness components currently scaffolded but not functional
- Pilot plan ready to execute once harness available

## Next Actions
- **Option A**: Implement minimal harness to execute pilot (out of scope for this task)
- **Option B**: Document remaining steps 7-12 as plans (continue current approach)
- **Option C**: Mark experiment as "design complete, ready for implementation"
