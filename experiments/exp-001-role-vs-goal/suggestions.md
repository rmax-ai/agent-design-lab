# Suggestions for Improvement - exp-001-role-vs-goal

## Task Execution Improvements

### 1. Automation Opportunities
- Consider creating helper scripts for common operations (with awareness they should be general-purpose)
- Template generators for run manifests could reduce errors

### 2. Documentation
- execution-plan.md is clear and actionable
- Would benefit from links to related files (research.md, manifest.md)

### 3. Tracking Infrastructure
- Current approach: separate files for status, notes, suggestions, feedback
- Could benefit from timestamps on each entry
- Status file uses checkboxes for easy progress visualization

### 4. Workflow Clarity
- The 12-step plan is comprehensive
- Each step has clear deliverables and exit criteria
- Estimated effort timelines help with planning

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding a CHANGELOG.md for experiment-level changes
- Version control strategy for iterative improvements to tasks/variants
- Automated validation scripts for manifest/scorecard schemas
