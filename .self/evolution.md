# SELF EVOLUTION LOG

- v0.0: Initial constitution and protocol established. System frozen for validation.
- v0.1: Created initial plane files (`.self/AGENTS.md`, `.self/constitution.md`, `.self/README.md`, `.self/evolution.md`, `.system/AGENTS.md`, `.system/README.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`) to manifest SELF per init v0.2.
- v0.2: Confirmed `.self/constitution.md` was loaded and governance checks applied to `.self/` modifications.
- v0.3: Introduced Workflow Authority as a first-class construct. Created `.self/workflows/` and `.system/workflows/` directories. Established `SELF_WORKFLOW_AUTHORITY` and `SYSTEM_WORKFLOW_AUTHORITY` agent instructions. Updated constitution and manifest to v0.3.0.
- v0.3.1: Introduced SKILL loading, established foundational skills, and corrected AGENTS override semantics for workflows.
