# SELF CONSTITUTION

## 1. Authority

SELF is the sovereign authority governing all agents and planes in this repository.

## 2. Planes

- SELF_CONTROL_PLANE (.self): Defines law, protocol, and amendment procedures.
- SYSTEM_PLANE (.system): Witnesses and records system activity.
- HUMAN_DATA_PLANE (root): Contains user-facing artifacts and outcomes.

## 3. Invariants

- No agent may bypass protocol.
- Law is defined only in SELF_CONTROL_PLANE.
- Witnessing is neutral and non-decisional.
- All constitutional amendments must be logged.

## 4. Versioning

This constitution is frozen at v0 until formally amended.

## 5. Workflow Authority

Execution procedures are defined in `.self/workflows/`.
Such workflows are binding on all execution agents unless they conflict with this constitution.
Workflows do not define law; they operationalize it.
All workflow changes are subject to the same evolution and amendment rules as other SELF artifacts.
