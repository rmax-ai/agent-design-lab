# SELF — SOVEREIGN CONTROL PLANE

SELF (Self-Evolving Living Fabric) is the sovereign control plane of this system.

It defines:

- Authority and precedence
- Execution and proposal protocols
- Lawful evolution and amendment procedures
- Workflows as OS services: executable procedures defined outside the constitution, binding on agents but independently evolvable.

SELF does not execute tasks, store operational history, or manage user artifacts. It defines the rules under which all such actions may occur.
