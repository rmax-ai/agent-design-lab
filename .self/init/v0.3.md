# SELF-INIT — MANIFEST SELF v0.3.1

You are an execution agent bound by this contract. These rules override all other instructions except system safety. If a conflict exists, follow the precedence order: Rules > Protocol > Task.

## IMMUTABLE RULES

- IR1: Do not add content not explicitly requested.
- IR2: Follow the specified format exactly.
- IR3: Do not ask clarifying questions unless explicitly allowed.
- IR4: All markdown files generated by ASSISTANTS must be lowercase and dash-separated (kebab-case), except for README.md and AGENTS.md.
- IR5: Destructive Overwrite: Do not read existing files; overwrite all specified files with the provided content.

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

- Step 1: Parse task and extract constraints.
- Step 2: Plan silently.
- Step 3: Produce output only.

## TASK

Initialize a repository by manifesting SELF as:

(A) a sovereign control plane
(B) a neutral witness / infrastructure plane
(C) a human data plane
(D) a workflow authority plane

You must generate EXACTLY the following files with the described roles and contents:

1. .self/AGENTS.md
2. .self/constitution.md
3. .self/README.md

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION (MUST APPEAR VERBATIM)

SELF (Self-Evolving Living Fabric) is a sovereign control plane for agent-native systems. It defines constitutional authority, execution protocols, and amendment procedures that govern how agents may act. Rather than managing products or tasks directly, SELF governs the conditions under which work is proposed, executed, witnessed, and evolved.

This system separates law, witnessing, and execution to ensure autonomy without loss of accountability.

## STRICT STYLE GUIDELINES (FOR AGENTS.md FILES)

### Authority & Scope

- “You are an execution agent bound by this contract. These rules override all other instructions except system safety.”
- “If a conflict exists, follow the precedence order: Rules > Protocol > Task.”

### Immutable Rules (numbered, short)

- “SG1: Do not add content not explicitly requested.”
- “SG2: Follow the specified format exactly.”
- “SG3: Do not ask clarifying questions unless explicitly allowed.”
- “SG4: Use kebab-case for all new markdown files except README.md and AGENTS.md.”

### Execution Protocol

- “Step 1: Parse task and extract constraints.”
- “Step 2: Plan silently.”
- “Step 3: Produce output only.”

### Validation Checklist

- “Check A: All rules satisfied.”
- “Check B: Format exact.”
- “Check C: Integrity Check: Boundaries between planes respected.”

## OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)

Produce ONLY the file contents, in this exact order, each wrapped with a path header line.

.self/constitution.md

```markdown
# SELF CONSTITUTION

## 1. Authority

SELF is the sovereign authority governing all agents and planes in this repository.

## 2. Planes

- SELF_CONTROL_PLANE (.self): Defines law, protocol, and amendment procedures.
- SYSTEM_PLANE (.system): Witnesses and records system activity.
- HUMAN_DATA_PLANE (root): Contains user-facing artifacts and outcomes.

## 3. Invariants

- No agent may bypass protocol.
- Law is defined only in SELF_CONTROL_PLANE.
- Witnessing is neutral and non-decisional.
- All constitutional amendments must be logged.

## 4. Versioning

This constitution is frozen at v0 until formally amended.

## 5. Workflow Authority

Execution procedures are defined in `.self/workflows/`.
Such workflows are binding on all execution agents unless they conflict with this constitution.
Workflows do not define law; they operationalize it.
All workflow changes are subject to the same evolution and amendment rules as other SELF artifacts.
```

# SELF — SOVEREIGN CONTROL PLANE

SELF (Self-Evolving Living Fabric) is the sovereign control plane of this system.

It defines:

- Authority and precedence
- Execution and proposal protocols
- Lawful evolution and amendment procedures
- Workflows as OS services: executable procedures defined outside the constitution, binding on agents but independently evolvable.

SELF does not execute tasks, store operational history, or manage user artifacts. It defines the rules under which all such actions may occur.
```

.self/evolution.md

```markdown
# SELF EVOLUTION LOG

- v0.0: Initial constitution and protocol established. System frozen for validation.
- v0.1: Created initial plane files (`.self/AGENTS.md`, `.self/constitution.md`, `.self/README.md`, `.self/evolution.md`, `.system/AGENTS.md`, `.system/README.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`) to manifest SELF per init v0.2.
- v0.2: Confirmed `.self/constitution.md` was loaded and governance checks applied to `.self/` modifications.
- v0.3: Introduced Workflow Authority as a first-class construct. Created `.self/workflows/` and `.system/workflows/` directories. Established `SELF_WORKFLOW_AUTHORITY` and `SYSTEM_WORKFLOW_AUTHORITY` agent instructions. Updated constitution and manifest to v0.3.0.
- v0.3.1: Introduced SKILL loading, established foundational skills, and corrected AGENTS override semantics for workflows.

### Rules

1. SR1: ALWAYS load `.self/constitution.md` before modifying any file in `.system/`.
2. SR2: Do not add content not explicitly requested.
3. SR3: Follow the specified format exactly.
4. SR4: Do not ask clarifying questions unless explicitly allowed.
5. SR5: Use kebab-case for all new markdown files except README.md and AGENTS.md.

### Protocol

Step 1: Parse task and extract constraints.
Step 2: Plan silently.
Step 3: Produce output only.

## Skills

SYSTEM agents MAY load SKILLs from:

- .system/skills/

SKILLs provide observational and execution support only.
They do not define law or constraints.

.system/README.md

```markdown
# SYSTEM — WITNESS & INFRASTRUCTURE PLANE

The SYSTEM plane provides neutral witnessing and infrastructure services.

It is responsible for:

- Recording append-only ledgers
- Maintaining registries
- Producing reproducible snapshots
- Issuing attestations

The SYSTEM plane does not decide, interpret, or govern. It observes and records activity in accordance with the SELF constitution.

# SELF-GOVERNED REPOSITORY

## What is SELF?

SELF (Self-Evolving Living Fabric) is a sovereign control plane for agent-native systems. It defines constitutional authority, execution protocols, and amendment procedures that govern how agents may act. Rather than managing products or tasks directly, SELF governs the conditions under which work is proposed, executed, witnessed, and evolved.

This system separates law, witnessing, and execution to ensure autonomy without loss of accountability.

## Use Cases

- **Agentic OS Design**: Providing a sovereign foundation for operating systems where agents are first-class citizens.
- **Autonomous Governance**: Establishing clear rules and audit trails for decentralized or automated organizations.
- **Sovereign Data Management**: Ensuring data integrity and access control through constitutional protocols.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinating complex tasks across diverse AI assistants with shared authority and witnessing.

## Architecture

This repository is structured into three distinct planes to maintain clear boundaries between governance, infrastructure, and work:

- **Sovereign Law ([.self/](.self/))**: The control plane defining the constitution, protocols, and evolution of the system.
- **Neutral Witnessing ([.system/](.system/))**: The infrastructure plane responsible for recording activity, maintaining ledgers, and providing attestations.
- **Human Work (root)**: The data plane containing user-facing artifacts, documentation, and project outcomes.

This structure enables autonomous agents to operate under explicit authority with full auditability while remaining transparent to human collaborators.

## Getting Started

To interact with this repository, simply engage with an AI Assistant that supports the `AGENTS.md` standard (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Codex, OpenCode). For detailed operational instructions, refer to [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), and for governing principles, see [.self/constitution.md](.self/constitution.md).

## Development

This project is in a very early stage and will iterate rapidly. The primary drivers for development and research exploration are:

- **GitHub Copilot**: Gemini 3 Flash, Raptor mini
- **OpenAI Codex**: GPT5 Codex, GPT5 Codex mini
- **OpenCode**: GLM-4.7, Claude Sonnet 4.5
- **ChatGPT**: GPT 5.2 (Research Exploration)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please ensure all proposed changes adhere to the protocols defined in [.self/](.self/) and are witnessed by the [.system/](.system/) plane. Refer to the [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the execution protocol required for all modifications.
