# SELF-GOVERNED REPOSITORY

## What is SELF?

SELF (Self-Evolving Living Fabric) is a sovereign control plane for agent-native systems. It defines constitutional authority, execution protocols, and amendment procedures that govern how agents may act. Rather than managing products or tasks directly, SELF governs the conditions under which work is proposed, executed, witnessed, and evolved.

This system separates law, witnessing, and execution to ensure autonomy without loss of accountability.

## Use Cases

- **Agentic OS Design**: Providing a sovereign foundation for operating systems where agents are first-class citizens.
- **Autonomous Governance**: Establishing clear rules and audit trails for decentralized or automated organizations.
- **Sovereign Data Management**: Ensuring data integrity and access control through constitutional protocols.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinating complex tasks across diverse AI assistants with shared authority and witnessing.

## Architecture

This repository is structured into three distinct planes to maintain clear boundaries between governance, infrastructure, and work:

- **Sovereign Law ([.self/](.self/))**: The control plane defining the constitution, protocols, and evolution of the system.
- **Neutral Witnessing ([.system/](.system/))**: The infrastructure plane responsible for recording activity, maintaining ledgers, and providing attestations.
- **Human Work (root)**: The data plane containing user-facing artifacts, documentation, and project outcomes.

This structure enables autonomous agents to operate under explicit authority with full auditability while remaining transparent to human collaborators.

## Getting Started

To interact with this repository, simply engage with an AI Assistant that supports the `AGENTS.md` standard (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Codex, OpenCode). For detailed operational instructions, refer to [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), and for governing principles, see [.self/constitution.md](.self/constitution.md).

## Development

This project is in a very early stage and will iterate rapidly. The primary drivers for development and research exploration are:

- **GitHub Copilot**: Gemini 3 Flash, Raptor mini
- **OpenAI Codex**: GPT5 Codex, GPT5 Codex mini
- **OpenCode**: GLM-4.7, Claude Sonnet 4.5
- **ChatGPT**: GPT 5.2 (Research Exploration)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please ensure all proposed changes adhere to the protocols defined in [.self/](.self/) and are witnessed by the [.system/](.system/) plane. Refer to the [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the execution protocol required for all modifications.
