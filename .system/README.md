# SYSTEM — WITNESS & INFRASTRUCTURE PLANE

The SYSTEM plane provides neutral witnessing and infrastructure services.

It is responsible for:

- Recording append-only ledgers
- Maintaining registries
- Producing reproducible snapshots
- Issuing attestations

The SYSTEM plane does not decide, interpret, or govern. It observes and records activity in accordance with the SELF constitution.
